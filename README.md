Odometer Reader is a simple application that allows users to read odometer readings through three different methods: uploading a picture of the odometer, taking a selfie with the odometer in the background, or manually inputting the reading into a text field.

## Project Structure

- `/css`: Contains the stylesheets for the application.
- `/js`: Contains the JavaScript files for the application.
- `/images`: Contains images and logos used in the project.

## Features

- **Upload Picture**: Upload an image containing the odometer, and let the application automatically extract and display the reading.
